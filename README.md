# LearningHistory

So I take a lot of online courses... It used to be simple to understand what I was learning by looking at my certifications.
Now with over 40 courses the section on my LinkedIn has become a cluttered mess.
I started this project with the intent of drawing insights from my own learning with a Dashboard in Power BI
I first had to map out and create a script for a database so that I could extract the data and create the dashboard.
